# SysOpSM
SysOp Smashin' Door Game (started in 1994 ... never finished) 
Uses DDPLUS 7.1 and Turbo Pascal 7.

This door was about a user fighting "bad" SysOp's and saving all the other users from terrible BBSing.  A local
caller to my BBS by the handle of TERRANCE! was set to become a secret helper such as "Racer X" from Speed Racer.
It never go too far along as life happened, as we all know.  It does compile and run the 1st stage.


Don't be too harsh, this was a first time learning experience with Turbo Pascal of a 14 year old Junior High kid. :)
That should be ALL the files  .... if someone wants to give it a go, great!  Always use another door game.  My only
request is that there is a DOS 16 bit build .exe of it as well.


Enjoy!!
