# SysOpSM
SysOp Smashin' Door Game (started in 1994 ... never finished) 
Uses DDPLUS 7.1 and Turbo Pascal 7.
Don't be too harsh, this was a first time learning experience with Turbo Pascal of a 14 year old Junior High kid. :)
That should be ALL the files  .... if someone wants to give it a go, great!  Always use another door game.  My only
request is that there is a DOS 16 bit build .exe of it as well.
